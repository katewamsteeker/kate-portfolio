I brought a traditional classroom sales course into the digital realm, leveraging my expertise in adult learning principles. My goal was to equip learners with comprehensive skills and techniques, elevating their sales performance from prospecting to closing.

Collaborating closely with subject matter experts and videographers, I ensured the development of high-quality and accurate content. The entire process, from course design to material creation and implementation on the Learning Management System (Brightspace by D2L), reflected a commitment to the sales community.

##### Innovative 8-Week Sales Course and Weekly Cycles

I storyboarded an 8-week sales course, breaking down each week into multiple topics to ensure a seamless learning journey.

 Each week, learners embark on cycles designed for optimal engagement and knowledge retention. Commencing with introductions, objectives, and activating prior knowledge, the cycles progress through curated readings, videos, and practical activities. Continuous reinforcement is achieved through activities, quizzes, and templates, culminating in summaries and knowledge checks for sustained continuity.

##### Integration of Technology

My proficiency extends across a suite of tools, each strategically employed to enhance the learning experience:

- **Adobe Photoshop:** Used for creative visual elements to enrich course content.
- **Adobe Editor:** Ensured a polished and professional look for textual elements.
- **PowerPoint:** Leveraged for dynamic and visually compelling presentations.
- **Wondershare Filmora:** Applied for video editing to enhance engagement with multimedia content.
- **Zoom:** Facilitated virtual engagement and collaboration.
- **Brightspace by D2L (LMS):** Utilized for streamlined course delivery and management.

##### Developed Components:

- **Knowledge Check Quiz Questions:** Formulated quizzes that assessed comprehension and reinforced key concepts.
- **Final Exam Questions:** Designed comprehensive final exam questions to evaluate overall course understanding that directly aligned to a competency framework.
- **Assignments and Syllabus:** Structured assignments and a syllabus for clear learning objectives and expectations.
