I brought a classroom sales course to life online, leveraging my expertise in adult learning principles to equip learners with the skills and techniques to improve their sales performance from prospecting to closing.

I worked with subject matter experts and videographers to develop the content and ensure quality and accuracy. Following the collection of materials, I assumed responsibility for designing the course, constructing the course materials, and creating the course in the learning management system, D2L.

I storyboarded the 8-week in-depth sales course, breaking down each week into multiple topics. 

 Each week of the course learners are taken through cycles that begin with introductions, objectives, and an activity to activate their prior knowledge (adult learners have lots to bring to the table!). The cycles continue with readings, videos, and activities/quizzes/templates to put their learning into action. The cycles close with summaries and knowledge checks. These cycle continues throughout the course for continuity.
