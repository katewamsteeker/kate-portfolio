I used Articulate Rise to build multiple on-demand online courses ranging in length from 1.5 - 3 hours designed for sales professionals who want to upgrade their skills, but with a course that fits into their busy schedules.  

The self-guided courses consist of a variety of readings, multimedia, and activities, including short knowledge check quizzes, downloadable PDF templates and thought provoking questions.  

##### The Response

> "We have been in business for over 40yrs, with an extensive dealer network but never was able to implement a structured or focused account management plan. The tools provided in this course are simple yet allow us to propely plan based on account potential and track account details." Jean, Sales Director

> "Awesome course, even for the most seasoned sales professional will see true value in this course." Carolyn, Key Account Manager
