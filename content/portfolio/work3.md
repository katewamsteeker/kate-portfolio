Utilizing Articulate Rise, I constructed a series of on-demand online courses tailored for sales professionals seeking skill enhancement. Ranging from 1.5 to 3 hours, these courses are thoughtfully designed to fit seamlessly into the demanding schedules of sales practitioners.

The self-guided courses present a curated blend of readings, multimedia elements, and dynamic activities. This includes concise knowledge check quizzes, downloadable PDF templates, and stimulating questions crafted to provoke thoughtful reflection. These bite-sized learning experiences ensure immediate applicability in the professional landscape.
