Collaborating seamlessly with subject matter experts, I designed monthly 90-minute virtual training sessions. These interactive webinars, hosted on esteemed platforms such as GoToWebinar and Zoom, are thoughtfully structured to elevate the learning journey:

- **Engaging Interactivity:** Infused with live chat and discussions, participants actively contribute to the discourse, enhancing the collective learning experience.
- **Poll Questions:** Strategic incorporation of polls to gauge participant understanding and encourage real-time engagement.
- **Downloadable Resources:** Empowering learners with downloadable templates, ensuring practical application of acquired knowledge.
- **Dedicated Q&A Periods:** Facilitating Q&A sessions, providing participants with a direct channel to deepen their understanding.
